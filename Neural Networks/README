I added matplotlib so that I could plot my gradient descent graphs
When you run my code it should pop up, the numbers are also output to console.

To run the Stochastic gradient descent, simply run the SGD.py file
There is an argument in the stochastic_gradient_descent called 'init_type'
It is currently set to random, but you can change it to 'zeros' to run that implementation

To run the neural network code just run nn.py and it runs all variations of it

To run the logistic regression model, run log_reg.py
Change the 'est_type' param in stochastic_gradient_descent() to 'MAP' or to 'ML' depending on how you want to run it.
